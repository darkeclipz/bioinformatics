# Bioinformatics

This repository contains some amateur research in Bioinformatics.

Before starting this repository, I had zero knowledge of the field of Bioinformatics. With the recent COVID-19 development, I found it interesting to learn a little bit more about this field.

**Do not draw any conclusions from this repository, I am not an expert in anything biology.**

## Definitions

This is a list of all the definitions:

 * _cell_: individual compartments that compose into an organism. A cell stores all the information to make a replica of itself, including the machinery required to collect and manufacture its components, carry out the copying process, and kick-start its new offspring.
 * _pathway_: a complex network of chemical reactions which dedicate the cells decisions.
 * _DNA_: holds a vast library describing how the cells work.
 * _RNA_: acts to transfer certain short pieces of this library to different places in the cell, at which point those smaller volumes of information are used as templates to synthesize proteins.
 * _proteins_: form enzymes that perform biochemical reactions, send signal to other cells, and otherwise perform the actual work of the cell.

## Genome sequence for COVID-19
