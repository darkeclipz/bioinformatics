# Bioinformatics

This repository contains some amateur research in Bioinformatics.

Before starting this repository, I had zero knowledge of the field of Bioinformatics. With the recent COVID-19 development, I found it interesting to learn a little bit more about this field.

**Do not draw any conclusions from this repository, I am not an expert in anything biology.**
