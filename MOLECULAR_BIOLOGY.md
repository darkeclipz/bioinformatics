## Definitions

Flow of information:

    DNA -> transcription -> RNA -> translation -> protein

This is a list of all the definitions:

 * _cell_: individual compartments that compose into an organism. A cell stores all the information to make a replica of itself, including the machinery required to collect and manufacture its components, carry out the copying process, and kick-start its new offspring. [15]
 * _pathway_: a complex network of chemical reactions which dedicate the cells decisions. [15]
 * _DNA_: holds a vast library describing how the cells work. DNA (nuclein) is a long molecule consisting of four types of bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). DNA, or _deoxyribonucleic acid_, is a simple molecule consisting of a sugar, a phosphate group (contained the element phosphorus), and one of four nitrogenous bases (A, T, G, or C). The chemical bonds linking together nucleotides in DNA are always the same such that the backbone of a DNA molecule is very regular. It is the A, T, C, and G bases that give "individuality" to each DNA molecule. The model is a double-stranded helical structure of DNA. The two strand are held together by hydrogen bonds between specific base pairings: A-T and C-G. [15]
 * _RNA_: acts to transfer certain short pieces of this library to different places in the cell, at which point those smaller volumes of information are used as templates to synthesize proteins. Chemically speaking, RNA, or _ribonucleic acid_, is almost the same as DNA. In RNA there is no T base, a similar U base takes its place, and an oxygen atom is added to the sugar component. These two seemingly minor differences have a major impact on biological roles of the two molecules. The effect is that RNA can carry short messages from the DNA to the cellular machinery that builds the protein, and it can actively participate in important chemical reactions. [15]
 * _proteins_: form enzymes that perform biochemical reactions, send signal to other cells, and otherwise perform the actual work of the cell. [15]
 * _genome_: is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA. The genome includes both the genes and the noncoding DNA, as well as mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA. The study of the genome is called _genomics_. [12]
 * _chromosome_: is a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageble tangle. [13]
 * _Chargaff rule_: there seems to be a one-to-one ratio of adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine content in DNA. [15]
 * _eukaryotic_: a cell that encapsulates DNA in a nucleus.[15]
 * _prokaryotic_: a cell that doesn't encapsulate DNA in a nucleus. [15]
 * _mRNA_: _messenger_ RNA that carries the genes genetic information to the ribosome to make a particular protein. [15]
 * _transcription_: In 1960 Jerard Hurwitz and Samuel Weiss identified a molecular machine (composed of many proteins) that uses DNA as a template and adds ribonucleatide by ribonucleotide to make RNA. This process is called _transcription_ and the molecular machine responsible for this process got the name _RNA polymerase_. How RNA polymerase knows where to start and stop transcribing DNA remains one of the many unsolved bioinformatics problems. [15]
 * _splicing_: In eukaryotes, a gene is typically broken into many pieces but it still produces a coherent protein. To do so, these cells have to cut the introns out of the RNA transcript and concatenate all the exons together prior to the mRNA entering the ribosome. The process of cutting and pasting the raw RNA version of the gene into the mRNA version that enters the ribosome is called _splicing_ and is quite complicated at the molecular level. [15]
 * _amino acid_: Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine and carboxyl functional groups, along with a side chain specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. [16] Amino acids are linked together into linear chains to form proteins. [15]
 * _codons_: triples to consecutive letters in DNA. There are 4^3 = 64 different codons, which is more than three times as large as the number of amino acids.  [15]
 * _triplet rule_: Triplets of consecutive letters in DNA (called codons) are responsible for the amino acid sequence in a protein. Thus a particular 30-base pair gene in DNA will make a protein of a specific 10 amino acids in a specific order.
 * _protein_: Proteins perform most of the chemical work in the cell, including copying DNA, moving materials inside the cell, and communicating with nearby cells. Researchers invest a large amountof effort into finding the structure of each protein; it is this structure that determines what role a protein plays in the cellâ€”does it participate in the DNA replication process, or does it take part in some pathway that helps thecell metabolize sugar faster? [15]
 * _protein complexes_: groups of proteins that clump together into a larget structure. 
 * _RNA polymerase_: A protein complex known as RNA polymerase, begins _transcribing_ a gene by copying its DNA base sequence into a short RNA base sequence (pairing a DNA T with an RNA A, a DNA A with an RNA U, and so on) called _messenger_ RNA, mRNA. [15]
 * _ribosomes_: the short mRNA molecule is attacked by larger molecular complexes known as _ribosomes_, which read consecutive codons and locate the corresponding amino acid for inclusion in the growing polypeptide chain. Ribosomes are, in effect, molecular factories where proteins are assembled. [15]

## Genetic code table

The genetic code, from the perspective of mRNA. The codon for methionine, or AUG, also acts as a "start" codon that initiates transcription. [15]
